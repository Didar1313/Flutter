# Flutter
Flutter code execution is fundamentally different from languages like C,which are typically executed in a linear fashion, line by line. In contrast, Flutter applications are event-driven and execute in a reactive manner. 
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern that allows systems to detect, process, manage, and react to real-time events as they happen
